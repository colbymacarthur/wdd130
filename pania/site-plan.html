          <h3>About us</h3>
          <p>Our artisan bakery began as a distant dream and as a way to contribute extra to the family economy, after being tremendously affected by the changes on the island and the oil industry.
          In April 2019 I started selling a limited variety of products to family and friends, mostly on weekends, time passed and in July 2019 due to the push of the most important people in my life (my mother, Mrs. Victoria Alvarez, and my Husband Colby MacArthur) who believed in the project and in me more than I believed myself, I decided to sell my products at the Carmen 2019 Fair.
          The project barely had an oven with 5 trays, 1 homemade blender and 5 large trays, we did not have a name that would define us, but there was a very strong desire to give everything and sell what we had offered in those couple of months to more people. .
          The Carmen fair turned out to be quite a physical and emotional challenge because we had no idea how many rolls we would sell, we worked from 4am to 12pm to supply the demand that had been generated. At the end of the Fair we continue selling in the facilities of the Victoria hotel
          We continued giving the project more shape and we began looking for a way to give it more identity. So, we set out to find a name that would mean something and that its logo would express the identity of my art and my passion.
          Pania was thought in honor of my last name PONNIAH
          and the female baker that appears in the logo is because I am a passionate baker, I love making bread and creating delicious foods that make others happy just by trying them, making good bread, with the best ingredients and quality .
          We continued training and believing in the project, we spent a lot of time in the kitchen experimenting and testing, creating new breads and looking for a way to reach more people, we decided to take a hotel room to turn it into a kitchen


          Time passed and we continued to grow in small steps, they closed 24th Street and we thought that it was the end of our project since access to customers was very difficult, our sales dropped and yet we decided to continue with the project, although not with the same motivation. The important role of those who surrounded me began to play because there were always words of motivation and push, we decided to move the bakery to a corner of the hotel and continue



          January 2019 we sold rosca de reyes and we continue looking for a way to attend events that would make us known in order to show people our products and have more customers.

          March 2020
          The Covid-19 pandemic began, we believed that it was the end of our business, and we began to look for strategies that would allow us to move forward, we closed our doors and sold through our window


          We made routes in our car offering to bring bread to the door of our clients, social networks became a very important work tool, we sought to survive and be able to continue since at that time it was our only source of income, we managed to maintain our sale of the products and little by little we began to sell more every day. Despite the adversity we continued motivated and willing to move forward.


          Despite the growth we experienced, we refused to hire people from outside as we feared getting sick from COVID, over time the increase in our orders led us to make the decision to hire people outside our family nucleus and our team began to form even more , we hired young people who had no experience in baking and worked hard in their training, we were lucky to find committed people who developed a taste for the art of making bread.

          Our team began to grow in less than a year, we no longer entered our kitchen, we had to expand and take another room at the Victoria hotel and turn it into another area of our kitchen.

            Despite the pandemic, we continued to grow and so did our menu. In that kitchen we trained and learned not to give up, we learned that if we are going to do something, we are going to do it well.

          PANIA continued to grow throughout 2021 and we decided to take a further leap by opening our doors to a larger area where our customers could have direct contact with our showcases and choose their breads. We start to prepare the old Victoria hotel reception now as our new store.


          Our kitchen also grew and we continued to literally break down the walls in order to be a bigger kitchen with more capacity.
          or work team, we started working in the kitchen with 2 people (me, Graciela Ponniah and Anahi Sanchez) in the store we started with 2 people (my husband Colby and my sister Veronica)
          Currently in the kitchen we are 14 people and in the store we are 9 people.

          We have never stopped dreaming and believing in ourselves and our ability to create and transmit it through bread, I learned that union is strength.
