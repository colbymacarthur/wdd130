    <h2>Colby MacArthur</h2>
    <h2>Orphan</h2>
    <p>I'm Colby MacArthur I grew up in Kaysville, Utah I served an LDS mission to southern Mexico and later moved to Guadalajara and married my wife Graciela. We have two kids Colby and Priya. We currently have a gourmet bakery and are working to expand and open new locations along the Yucatán peninsula. </p>
    <p>I finished the pathway program back in 2016 and am working towards a bachelors degree in software development. I've always enjoyed making websites through Wordpress and other sites but want to learn more and develop programs to use in our bakery and offer my services to other local businesses.</p>
    <p>I'm excited for this new adventure in my life and hope to learn from each of you and share our knowledge and passion for technology. Technology can be a huge help but finding the right program to fit my needs is always hard (that’s why I want to design my own programs) but when you find the right one it’s always a joy and makes my life a lot easier.</p>
